    There are legitimate scenarios where you want a setTimeout during input, right?  Eg. a long press gesture recognizer (no need to poll in RAF in that case).

    One way we can justify relying on somewhat magical heuristics is when developers can opt-out of them by following our guidance.  I.e. we provide a rational alternative for the API which by default behaves somewhat magically.  Along these lines, should we consider adding an additional argument to setTimeout that indicates the scheduling policy, eg. "interactive" or "best effort".  Then the default when unspecified ("auto") can use whatever heuristic we find best balances web compat and the user experience?There are legitimate scenarios where you want a setTimeout during input, right?

I.e. we provide a rational alternative for the API which by default behaves somewhat magically.  Along these lines, should we consider adding an additional argument to setTimeout that indicates the scheduling policy, eg. "interactive" or "best effort".  Then the default when unspecified ("auto") can use whatever heuristic we find best balances web compat and the user experience?There are legitimate scenarios where you want a setTimeout during input, right?  Eg. a long press gesture recognizer (no need to poll in RAF in that case).

    One way we can justify relying on somewhat magical heuristics is when developers can opt-out of them by following our guidance.
